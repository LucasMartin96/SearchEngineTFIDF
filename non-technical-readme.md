## Hello! 😊

Let me tell you about this cool project I've been working on. You know how Google does its magic when you search for stuff? Well, I built something similar but WAY smaller (obviously, I'm not trying to compete with Google here 😅).

### Project Overview

So basically, it's a search engine that can read books from Project Gutenberg 📚 (you know, that website with all the free classic books) and help you find specific stuff in them. Like, imagine you want to find all the times someone mentions "love" in *Pride and Prejudice* ❤️ - that kind of thing.

### How It Works

The cool part is how it works behind the scenes. It uses this thing called TF-IDF (fancy math stuff 🤓), which basically means if you search for "whale" in *Moby Dick* 🐋, it knows that's probably pretty important because, duh, it's a book about a whale. But if you find "whale" in *Romeo and Juliet*, that would be weird and super interesting! 🎭

### Technologies Used

I built it using .NET 8 (because I'm not a dinosaur 🦕 using old tech), and PostgreSQL for the database (because real developers don't use Excel as a database 😂). The whole thing is pretty fast because I added some tricks like caching (imagine keeping a cheat sheet in your brain 🧠) and parallel processing (like having multiple people read different parts of a book at the same time).

### Features

- **Automatic Processing**: You can just throw a book ID at it from Project Gutenberg, and it downloads and processes everything automatically. 🚀 No more copy-pasting stuff!
- **Relevant Results**: When you search, it gives you results ordered by how relevant they actually are, not just random matches.

### Personal Librarian Experience

It's like having your own personal librarian 📖 who's really good at finding stuff, but instead of taking forever to get back to you, they're powered by caffeine ☕️ and running at super speed! 🏃‍♂️💨

### Try It Out!

Want to try it out? Just clone it, update a few settings (you know, the boring but necessary stuff 🥱), and you're good to go. Just don't try to index the entire Project Gutenberg library at once - your computer might give you the evil eye for that one! 😅
